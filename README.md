## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - CSS (or TailwindCSS, depending on your project)
  
- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (or any other database you're using)

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrishnaM0310/SaveDontStress.git
   cd SaveDontStress/my-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed. If not, install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

   Run the following command to install all frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables** (if necessary):

   You may need to create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend folder to configure API endpoints, environment settings, etc. Example:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Run the frontend application**:

   After installing dependencies, you can start the frontend server by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   Navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd SaveDontStress/my-backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   You might need to set up a `.env` file in the backend directory for database credentials, API keys, etc. Example `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/savedontstress
   PORT=5000
   ```

3. **Run the Backend Application**:

   After installing the dependencies and configuring your environment variables, you can start the backend server by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend should now be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

---

## Running the App

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can interact with the application:

1. Open the frontend by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
2. The frontend will interact with the backend at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Make sure the backend server is running before trying to use the frontend, as the frontend makes requests to the backend API.

## Deployment

### Deploying Frontend on GitHub Pages

To deploy your frontend on GitHub Pages:

1. Add `gh-pages` package:

   ```bash
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```

2. In your `package.json` file, add the following fields:

   ```json
   "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/SaveDontStress",
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

3. Run the deploy script:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   Your frontend will now be live on GitHub Pages at the URL specified in the `homepage` field.

### Deploying Backend on Heroku (Example)

If you're using Heroku for the backend, here are the steps:

1. Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

2. Log in to Heroku:

   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

3. Create a new Heroku app:

   ```bash
   heroku create
   ```

4. Deploy the backend:

   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

5. Your backend should now be live on the Heroku URL provided.
